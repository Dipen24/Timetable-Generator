TIMETABLE GENERATOR - CURRENT LIMITATIONS

1. Course Credit Logic
   - Currently treats all credits as lecture hours (e.g., 4 credits = 4 lectures)
   - Needs to handle different credit structures:
     * Example: 4 credits might mean 3 lectures + 1 lab session
     * Different courses may have different credit-to-class distributions

2. Manual Timetable Creation
   - Currently only supports automatic generation
   - Need to consider adding:
     * Option to manually add classes to specific days/slots
     * Ability to drag and drop classes
     * Manual editing of automatically generated timetable
   - This feature might still be useful even after fixing generation logic as it provides:
     * Flexibility for special cases
     * Quick modifications without regeneration
     * Emergency adjustments

Note: These limitations should be addressed after consulting with teachers and administrators to understand:
- Specific credit hour distribution rules
- Preferred level of manual control over timetable
- Institution-specific requirements

in admin, add option to add number of lectures, tutorials and labs, then generate timetable accordingly.
